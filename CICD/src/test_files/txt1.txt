Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,e

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,



As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. at

“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”
